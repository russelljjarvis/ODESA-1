### TODO:  
- [x] Some Verilator Output
- [ ] CI verilator. Demonstrate that HDL engineers can automate and do code integration in the cloud just like the rest of the software world.
- [ ] verilator GTK wave verification of SNN signals
- [ ] Command line scripts lend themselves to automation, GUIs lend themselves to human intervention.
- [ ] Command line installation and execution of Lattice Ice Breaker for a relatively small network.
